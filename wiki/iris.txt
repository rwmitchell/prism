  == Description ==
  Colorize text based on line/row position
  == Goals ==
  1) multiple color tables to choose from
  2) color by number of chars
  3) color by word position
  4) color by row position
  5) Specify colors for columns
    - How can we specify groups of columns?
    - 1 : 2 : 3 4 5 : 6 8 : 7
    - how would we parse it?
    - how would we use the parsed list?
    - the simple goal would be to turn the user input into a color sequence
    - given the sequence above, we'd create a color palette as:
      ◌ A B C C C D E D
    - palette[5]
    - seq[ 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 4 ]
    - palette[ seq[ i ]  ]
    - for seq we do not specify the columns, but the colors
    - how do handle mismatch between palette entries and seq values?
