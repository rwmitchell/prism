Take Too Long

= Goal =
  - fun and witty way to announce the completion of long running jobs
  - customizable to specific commands
  - randomly select between multiple responses
  - most commands the program name is sufficient
    ◌ qfit
  - some commands the args are more important
    ◌ s
    ◌ ssh
= Issues =
  - where do we store the config file? shmem?
  - how do we store the config file?
    ◌ array sorted by program name?
    ◌ multiple array elements per program?
  - how do you search to find the matching elements to randomly choose between?
    ◌ |cmd|command|another|
      ▸ use strcasestr() to find the start position of each command
      ▸ count FS to get command number
    ◌ define a structure such that a given commands points to:
      ▸ number of phrases
      ▸ array of start positions for each phrase
      ▸ phrases
  - load file?
    ◌ parse each line
    ◌ add command to search string ("|cmd|cmd|")
    ◌ if we read each file via "sort FILE|", all commands would be grouped together
  - how are variables dealt with?
    ◌ how do we parse the string to sub in vars?
      ▸ use vars to put args in order
      ▸ replace all vars with %s
      ▸ use sprintf()


= Examples =
  s:Connection to $1 is closed  # simple example - s hgatm
  s:$$2 on $$1 has finished       # s hgatm show_tunnels - uses second argument
